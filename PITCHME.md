PROBLEMS
========
Launch (nobody bought it!)
 * Marketing confusion: accessory or a new system?
 * Tablet: is it a portable or an iPad or...?
 * Who is this for? Less powerful than PS3 or 360, hard to develop for, TVii???

Only Nintendo and a few indies published good games

Who cares about money? Nintendo is still having fun.

The Games
---------

#HSLIDE

###Smash Bros Brawl

Unbalanced (on purpose) design. 8 players!

Secretly a Pokémon game.

###Super Mario 3D World

Everyone is a cat. Need I say more?

###Pikmin

Streamlined RTS game, cute AF. Aliens on a juice cleanse. Weirdly realistic fruit.

###Mario Kart

Items get better as you lag behind, and AI adjusts skill to match yours (to a point).

Nintendo's culture is centered on creativity. They make games that are family-friendly, sometimes beginner-friendly. But are they an _inclusive_ company?

#HSLIDE

###Ways to be inclusive

 - Representation (gender, race, body, cultural experience)
 - Motivation (gameplay, story, characters, challenge)
 - Investment (time, money)

##Representation

###RUST

 - Player is dropped, naked and without supplies, in a world with other hostile players
 - April 2016, randomly assigned gender, age, race, and body type to every player _permanently_

#HSLIDE

"Why won’t you give the player base an option to choose their gender? I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play."

  - Support your indies!
  - Contact developers and publishers (it works!)
  - be nice to people online, report jerks
  - Make your own games with Twine, RPG Maker, Game Maker
  - Read good journalism: Austin Walker is doing a great job running Vice's waypoint.zone
  - Duckfeed.tv slack is a friendly place

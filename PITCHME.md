PROBLEMS
========
Launch (nobody bought it!)
 * Marketing confusion: accessory or a new system?
 * Tablet: is it a portable or an iPad or...?
 * Who is this for? Less powerful than PS3 or 360, hard to develop for, TVii???

Only Nintendo and a few indies published good games

Who cares about money? Nintendo is still having fun.

(also having ~$8bn of Wii cash in the bank helps)

###Smash Bros Brawl

Unbalanced on purpose design.
8 players! Secretly a Pokémon game.

Items get better as you lag behind, and AI adjusts skill to match yours (to a point).

Clever, low-stress platformer without jumping

Nintendo's culture is centered on creativity. They make games that are family-friendly, sometimes beginner-friendly. But are they an _inclusive_ company?

Representation (gender, race, body, cultural experience)
Motivation (gameplay, story, characters, challenge)
Investment (time, money)

Who plays games? Lots of people.

PROBLEMS
========
Launch (nobody bought it!)
 * Marketing confusion: accessory or a new system?
 * Tablet: is it a portable or an iPad or...?
 * Who is this for? Less powerful than PS3 or 360, hard to develop for, TVii???

Only Nintendo and a few indies published good games

Who cares about money? Nintendo is still having fun

The Games
---------

#HSLIDE

###Smash Bros Brawl

Unbalanced (on purpose) design. 8 players!

Secretly a Pokémon game

#HSLIDE

###Super Mario 3D World

Everyone is a cat. Up to 4-player cooperative play, works like a scramble in golf

###Pikmin

Streamlined RTS game, cute AF. Aliens on a juice cleanse. Weirdly realistic fruit

#HSLIDE

Nintendo's culture is centered on creativity. They make games that are family-friendly, sometimes beginner-friendly. But are they an _inclusive_ company?

#HSLIDE

###Ways to be inclusive

 - Representation (gender, race, body, cultural experience)
 - Motivation (gameplay, story, characters, challenge)
 - Investment (time, money)

#HSLIDE

###Who plays games?

###RUST

 - Player is dropped, naked and without supplies, in a world with other hostile players
 - April 2016, randomly assigned gender, age, race, and body type to every player _permanently_

#HSLIDE

"Why won’t you give the player base an option to choose their gender? I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play."

#HSLIDE

Many video game protagonists are ciphers and could be anyone. There's no excuse not to provide more representative options

<img src="https://zeldawiki.org/images/thumb/b/be/HWL_Linkle_Crossbow_Artwork.png/1343px-HWL_Linkle_Crossbow_Artwork.png" style="width: 50%;" />

#HSLIDE

High-budget games are trying harder
 - Assassin's Creed Syndicate: first mainline game to include a female protagonist (after outcry from not having female models available in multiplayer in previous game)
 - Mafia 3: black male protagonist, tries to portray racism of 60's New Orleans
     - not-totally-cringeworthy segregated diners, kkk, racist name-calling by enemies and passerby
     - police respond slower (or not at all) in poor neighborhoods
 - Watch_Dogs 2
     - black male protagonist who became a "hacktivist" because he was profiled by a crime-prevention software program
     - discusses gentrification and how terrible SF is

#HSLIDE

###Bioware

Anecdotally, Dragon Age and Mass Effect are common entry points into gaming. Why?

1. Focus on relationships with well-written characters
2. Not overly mechanical; systems reward engagmenet but don't require it
3. Good character creator and range of player charcter choices

Interesting contrast to Mario, which appears accessible but is almost purely mechanical. Are mechanics a niche?

#HSLIDE

###Dragon Age: Inquistion

 - Borrows mechanics from MMO games like World of Warcraft
 - Lukewarm reception from hardcore RPG fans, but developed a very strong fandom

But:
 - LGBT characterizations mostly centered around romance options
 - Solas is a jerk, but also the best-developed relationship

#HSLIDE

###Overwatch

Perhaps the broadest range of playble characters (and the best shipping) ever

<img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDQA0nWult_3h4knc6fWRykalqk=/260x0:1735x830/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49663697/Overwatch_hero.0.0.jpg" />

#HSLIDE

###Overwatch

 - Variety of roles and importance of teamwork allow less-skilled players to contribute
 - Low time investment: matches end quickly, rewards are cosmetic, matchmaking helps 
 - Blizzard works hard to police community (but you should probably turn off chat anyway)

#HSLIDE

###Gaming is expanding

4207 games were  released on Steam last year

#HSLIDE

The proliferation of tools and distribution methods have empowered makers of small, focused, more personal games

#HSLIDE

###Investment

Mobile games are huge and accessible
Addictive gameplay, microtransactions are worrying

<img src="https://d1ax1i5f2y3x71.cloudfront.net/items/0G3x3B240B3K0U150X3L/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-27%20at%208.24.52%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2671635" />
<div class="source">Source: https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/market-brief-year-in-review/</div>

#HSLIDE

###More barriers
 - "Hardcore gaming" and difficulty is an exclusive culture, and most hard games are really just rewarding time investment
 - Violence is a game design crutch, and often is dissonant with the story of the game (e.g. Uncharted 4)

#HSLIDE

###Recapitulation

1. Games need to continue to work on representation - and we need to keep pressuring developers
2. Narrative, characterization, and treating mechanics and violence like the niche they are will expand the audience
3. Nintendo, Bioware, Blizzard, and indies are pushing the industry forward in positive ways

#HSLIDE

###Things you can do

  - Support your indies!
  - Contact developers and publishers (it works!)
  - Be nice to people online, report jerks
  - Make your own games: Twine, RPG Maker, Game Maker
  - Read good journalism: Austin Walker is doing a great job running Vice's waypoint.zone
  - Duckfeed.tv slack is a friendly place to nerd out

#HSLIDE

This is a huge topic. Let's keep talking about this.

#HSLIDE

Let's play some games!
